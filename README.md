# Update CSS Variables with JS

It's a Wes Bos JS 30 day challenge, day 3. New project and something new to learn. From this one I learned how to update CSS variables with JS. I been sure that if I wanted to do something like this that is possible with SASS and JS, but with CSS variables and JS looks easier for me.
I added one more input for color which allows changing background color.
